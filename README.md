# Forum
Discussion Forum. 

# How it works
* The system is built 100% in PHP (some HTML, Javascript and JQuery knowledge is required).
* CSS used for the UI.
* This forum includes an user authentication (secure login/registration system), posting system and posts displaying system. The user will be able to create, edit and delete a post as long as the user has signed in. The forum shows information such as what user has created the post, who has responded to a specific post, and how many views and responses the post has. Login functionality: 
a) User who is currently not login (limited access). 
b) User currently logged in (have control to its own account)

# Requirements

* Web Server (I personally use XAMPP).
